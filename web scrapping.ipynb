      "1 : Some investors tiptoe back into Treasuries, as hawkish Fed clouds outlook\n",
      "Betting on upside in Treasuries has been a risky proposition this year. Interest rates, which move inversely to Treasury prices, have galloped higher in 2022 as the central bank has grown progressively more hawkish, dealing the U.S. government bond market its worst start to the year in history and gouging investors betting the selloff would abate.\n",
      "2 : Nifty bears swoop as Powell fires fresh salvo; this is how hawkish the Fed could be\n",
      "At the beginning of the current calendar year, several analysts were of the view that the Fed may hike rates by a total of around 250 basis points in 2022. That estimation has been significantly revised upward.\n",

      "4 : Shyam Sekhar says popular market trends, themes scare him. Here's why\n",
      "The storytelling repeatedly, Sekhar said, can take money into very good companies like an Asian Paints, or a Bajaj Finance or it can take it into very cyclical companies, which may not do well.\n",

      "6 : Sensex tanks 600 pts, Nifty below 17,200; Hindalco falls 2%, HCL Tech rises 2% post Q4 results\n",
      "Equity markets halted their two-day rally in early trade on Friday, with the Sensex tumbling nearly 667 points, reflecting weak global markets and selling in index majors HDFC Bank and TCS. Continuous foreign fund outflows also dented sentiments. The BSE benchmark Sensex was trading 666.85 points lower at 57,244.83. The Nifty also declined 196.55 points to 17,196.05.\n",
      "7 : L&T Technology shares tank 5% after Q4 results\n",
      "\"While LTTS is well-positioned to play the ERD theme and grow at premium rates, we do not find the risk-reward favourable. We value the stock at 32x (earlier 34x) FY24E EPS. Maintain REDUCE rating with a revised target price of Rs 3,908 from Rs 4,413,\" brokerage ICICI Securities said in a note.\n",
      "8 : ICICI Lombard skids 6% as Q4 net profit falls 10% YoY to Rs 313 crore\n",
      "The gross direct premium income (GDPI) of the company stood at Rs 4,666 crore in the quarter under review as compared to Rs 3,478 crore in the year-ago period, ICICI Lombard said in a statement.\n",
      "9 : Rallis India tanks 9% as Tata Chemicals arm posts Rs 14 crore loss in Q4\n",
      "Rallis India’s counter plunged to a low of Rs 255.25 as against Rs 281.10 at previous close on the BSE. The stock was last trading 6 per cent lower.\n",
      "10 : Powell's 50 bps rate hike comment brings abrupt end to 2-day rally\n",
      "In a panel discussion held by the International Monetary Fund during its spring meetings, Chair Jerome Powell suggested that “there’s something in the idea of front-loading” aggressive rate hikes as the Fed grapples with inflation that has reached a four-decade high. \n"
